1. Allocate a few nodes (it also works with 1), but with more nodes you are more likely to hit the issue

   salloc -N 14 --ntasks-per-node 32 --cpus-per-task 9

2. Compile and execute:

   bash run.sh

3. Check the output in out.log

   ==> The runtimes should vary a lot. An example is included in the output.

4. You can change the file wrapper.sh and bind to specific cores (there is a note in the file)
   and then run with

   salloc -N 1 --ntasks-per-node 32 --cpus-per-task 9
   SLURM_NTASKS=1 bash run.sh

   If you bind to the "right" cores, it happens on single node, too.
